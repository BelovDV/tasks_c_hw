if not stated opposite - return int is return "was error"

it's bad, but because of architecture problem it isn't possible
	to use 0 constant in asm1
	if you want to write symbol use 4 instead
it's bad, but because of architecture problem it isn't possible
	to use data you couldn't use labels
	it's required to pass offset with registers
it's bad, but you can't easily change mode for some time
	should be done

call agreement have changed.
	passed arguments -- r4, r5, r6, r7
	accepted arguments -- r0, r1, r2, r3
	lib call arguments -- r4, r5, r6, r7
	syscall arguments -- r0, r1, r2, r3



IDEAS asm2:
	write function, produced offset of label from current position
	use it for call, jmp, mov, etc..
